"""
truck_stop_finder.py  -  Find the best 2 diesel stops for a truck.

SCORING:
  Uses true cost formula — not just cheapest price or nearest stop.

  true_cost = (diesel_price × gallons_to_fill)
            + (detour_miles × 2 × diesel_price / mpg)

  This means a stop that is cheaper but far off-route might actually
  cost MORE than a slightly pricier stop that is directly on the route.

CORRIDOR:
  For MOVING trucks, only considers stops within CORRIDOR_WIDTH_MILES
  either side of the truck's heading direction, up to SEARCH_CORRIDOR_MILES.
  Stops behind the truck get a distance penalty instead of being excluded,
  to handle bad heading data from Samsara gracefully.

URGENCY TIERS:
  35–26%  ADVISORY   Search full corridor, price-optimized
  25–16%  WARNING    Shorter corridor, still price-optimized
  15–10%  CRITICAL   Nearest reachable stop, price ignored
  <10%    EMERGENCY  Absolute nearest stop, price ignored

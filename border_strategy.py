border_strategy.py — Smart fuel strategy for expensive and low-stop states

Rules:
1. AVOID fueling in expensive states (CA, WA, OR, CT, MA, RI, NH)
2. Before entering expensive/low-stop state:
   - Calculate miles to exit that state
   - Fill exactly enough to exit + 15% buffer at last cheap stop before border
3. After each delivery stop → send new route briefing for remaining legs
4. Never recommend a stop inside an avoid state unless truck cannot exit on fuel

State categories:
  AVOID_STATES     — expensive, never fuel here if possible
  LOW_STOP_STATES  — sparse stops, must have enough to enter safely
  BOTH             — expensive AND sparse (MA, CT, RI, NH)
